    """Recompute nodes aliasing or downcasting any parameter

    In ZeRO3, sharded parameters are gathered before use and the gathered
    parameters should be freed once they are no longer needed to save GPU
    memory.

    When DeepCompile is active for ZeRO3, parameter gathering is done by custom
    passes after the joint graph captured by Dynamo and AOT Autograd is
    partitioned into fwd and bwd parts. Since the partitioner has no clue about
    parameter sharding now, the partitioned graphs will save for backward all
    intermediate activations including those aliasing the gathered parameters.
    That essentially nullifies the memory reduction that ZeRO3 is designed to
    bring.

    The solution is to recompute the parameter-aliasing activations in the
    backward. It is done by marking such nodes as MUST_RECOMPUTE and reusing the
    min-cut partitioner originally designed for checkpointing. If autocast is
    enabled, parameter downcasts are also recomputed.

    This cannot be converted to a standalone pass because it must be applied
    before partitioning the joint graph, but passes run after the partitioning.

    TODO(eternalNight) `min_cut_rematerialization_partition` may recompute more
    nodes than required for ZeRO3. Need investigate its performance
    implications.
